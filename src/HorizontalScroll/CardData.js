    content: `Thumba had the special geographical advantage of lying close to the magnetic equator. Vikram Sarabhai realised that the electrojet found above the magnetic equator could be the perfect subject of study to kickstart India’s space program. And so, a station was set up in Thumba. On 21 November 1963, Nike-Apache took off from Thumba. It was a sounding rocket, i.e. a rocket carrying measuring instruments. It is seen in this image on the launch pad at Thumba beach.`,
